    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This French delicacy is extremely versatile, 
      as it can be filled with virtually anything -- fruits, 
      pudding, mousse for desserts as well as vegetables and
      meats for dinner. No need to add more oil each time 
      unless the pan begins to stick. Freeze extra crepes for 
      later use.</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>2 eggs</li>
      <li>1 cup milk</li>
      <li>2/3 cup all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>1 pinch salt</li>
      <li>1 1/2 teaspoons vegetable oil</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>In a blender combine eggs, milk flour, salt and oil.
        Process until smooth. Cover and refrigerate 1 hour.</li>
      <li>Heat a skillet over medium-high heat and brush with
        oil. Pour 1/4 cup of crepe batter into pan, tilting to
        completely coat the surface of the pan. Cook 2 to 5
        minutes, turning once, until golden. Reapeat with
        remaining batter</li>
    </ol>
