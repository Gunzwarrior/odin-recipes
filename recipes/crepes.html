    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This French delicacy is extremely versatile, 
      as it can be filled with virtually anything -- fruits, 
      pudding, mousse for desserts as well as vegetables and
      meats for dinner. No need to add more oil each time 
      unless the pan begins to stick. Freeze extra crepes for 
      later use.</p>
